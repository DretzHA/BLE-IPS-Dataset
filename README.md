# BLE-IPS-Dataset
A Comprehensive BLE-Compliant Dataset for Indoor Positioning Systems

This repository provides access to a dataset for indoor positioning systems (IPS). It includes measurements of Angle of Arrival (AoA), IQ data, and RSSI, along with both the real and estimated positions of a BLE transmitter. The data was collected in a 10×8 meter room with obstacles and seven anchors.

Transmitters were tested under various conditions—both inside and outside personal protective equipment (PPE), including different anchor orientations, numbers of transmitters, calibration setups, and both static and dynamic scenarios. The goal is to support the development of robust IPS algorithms suitable for safety and complex environments. Anchors from multiple manufacturers were used to enable a detailed comparison of hardware performance under consistent test conditions.

Details about the dataset can be found in the article: A. Fabris, O. K. Rayel, J.L. Rebelatto, G.L. Moritz, M.E.P. Monteiro, and G.S. Peron, "A Comprehensive BLE-Compliant Dataset for Indoor Positioning Systems".
